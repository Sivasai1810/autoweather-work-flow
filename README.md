2)TELEGRAM_BOT_WORKFLOW :: I developed an Ai-powered Telegram bot that automatically responds to user messages using OpenAI language model. Whenever a user sends a message to the bot on Telegram the message is forwarded to OpenAI API  The response generated by the AI is then sent back to the user through the same Telegram bot, creating a real-time conversational experience.
